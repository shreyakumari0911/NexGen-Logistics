## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Data Sources
Edit `data_loader.py` to point to your data sources:

```python
# Current (CSV from /data folder)
orders = pd.read_csv("data/orders.csv")

# Can be replaced with:
# - Database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
# - APIs (AWS S3, Azure Blob)
# - Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery)
```

### Adjusting Model Parameters
Edit `model.py` to tune the Random Forest:

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,      # Number of trees
    max_depth=10,          # Tree depth
    min_samples_leaf=5,    # Minimum samples per leaf
    class_weight="balanced" # Handle class imbalance
)
```
